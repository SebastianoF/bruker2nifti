#### To use the GUI for your python distribution

If the selected python distribution has the libraries already installed and the 
root directory of the code is added to the PYTHONPATH, to run
the GUI, in the root you can just type: 
```
python GUI/open_GUI.py
```
To create a 'launcher' based on an ad-hoc virtual environment double click
on the run_setupper_YOUR_DISTIBUTION.
This will create a virtualenvironment with the required libraries and an 
executable file `OpenGUIbru2nii`, that will launch the GUI, and whose location can
be changed.

#### Warning
At the present the setupper is tested for MAC.
